# Help-master

This is my first resource so please don't be too strict.Besides, it's not a big and stunning script.
Still, I wanted to start small. Because everyone started small.

Installation: 1. Download Help-master
              2. Extract the Help-master Folder
              3. Rename the Folder in "Help"
              4. Put the Folder in your Resources Folder of the Server
              5. Add "start Help" to your Server config
              6. Rdy!
              


Sry for my bad english.

Use the Console and wrote /help 
You can edit the msg in the "help-c.lua" file
